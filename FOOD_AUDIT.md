## 📝 **RECOMMENDATION**

Since the task requires **3 meals and 2 snacks per day**, but the original menu doesn't have a separate "Snacks" category, snacks should be selected from the existing meal items (breakfast, lunch/dinner, sides).

**Action Items:**
1. Remove the fabricated "snacks" section
2. Remove "desserts" section (not in provided menu)
3. Remove "condiments" section (not in provided menu)
4. Remove "beverages" section (not in provided menu)
5. Keep only: Breakfast, Lunch/Dinner, and Sides
6. Users build their 2 daily snacks from these existing categories

**Note:** If desserts, condiments, and beverages ARE part of the actual Children's National menu but weren't included in the screenshots, please provide those menu pages and I'll add them back with correct items.
